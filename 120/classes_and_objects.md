# Classes and Objects

1. Everything in Ruby is an Object!
2. Objects are created from Classes
  * An object is an *instance* of a class 
3. Individual objects contain different information from other objects 
yet they are instances of the same class

#### Example 1:
```ruby
"hello".class # => String

"goodbye".class # => String
```

Both `"hello"` and `"goodbye"` objects in this example are *instances* of String class
