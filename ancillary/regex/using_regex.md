## Overview

  * There are many methods available in both Ruby and JavaScript that use regex.
  * Many of these are methods of the `Regexp` (Ruby) and `RegExp` (JavaScript) classes, but some of the most commonly used methods are those of the `String` classes of Ruby and JavaScript

<a name='matching-strings'></a>
## Matching Strings

  * The `match` method is one of the most basic methods for matching regex patterns
  * The `match` method returns a value that indicates whether a match was made and what exactly was matched
  * This return value is 'truthy' and can be tested in a conditional expression in either Ruby or JavaScript to test if a given string matched a regex

Examples:

  * In the following two examples, `fetch_url` is only called if the `text` variable contains a string that looks like a URL (as defined by the regex).

```ruby
# ruby

fetch_url(text) if text.match(/\Ahttps?:\/\/\S+\z/)
```

```javascript
// javascript

if (text.match(/^https?:\/\/\S+$/)) {
  fetch_url(text);
}
```

  * The method returns an object (specifically a `MatchData` object in Ruby) if a match is made, and `nil` (Ruby) or `null` (JavaScript) if there is no match
  * Ruby's [String#match](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html#method-i-match) method
    * Ruby's [String#=~](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html#method-i-3D-7E) method is similar to `String#match`, but returns the index within the String at which the regex matched (if a match is made) rather than a `MatchData` object; (both methods return `nil` in the event of no match). It is also faster than `String#match`
    * Ruby's [String#scan](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html#method-i-scan) method; it is a global form of match that returns an array of all matching substrings
  * JavaScript's [String.prototype.match](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match) method

<a name='splitting-strings'></a>
## Splitting Strings

  * Quite often when dealing with strings, they need to be split into smaller sub-strings in order to be processed or analysed.
  * Such substrings are often delineated by some sort of special character, such as the newline or tab characters
  * In order to break up strings into sub-strings, the `split` method is often used
  * `split` is often used with a simple string as a delineator rather than a regex, which is fine if the delineators occur in a uniform patterns within the string
  * If the delineators don't occur in a uniform pattern within the string, a regex can be useful

Examples:

```ruby
"xyzzy\t3456\t334\tabc".split("\t") # => ['xyzzy', '3456', '334', 'abc']
"xyzzy  3456  \t  334\t\t\tabc".split("\t") # => ["xyzzy  3456  ", "  334", "", "", "abc"]
"xyzzy  3456  \t  334\t\t\tabc".split(/\s+/) # => ["xyzzy", "3456", "334", "abc"]
```

  * Ruby's [String#split](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html#method-i-split) method
  * JavaScript's [String.prototype.split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) method

<a name='capturing-groups'></a>
## Capturing Groups

  * Capturing groups are defined by grouping part of a match patterns in parentheses
  * Capturing groups capture information from a matched string
  * Information captured by a capture group can later be used within the same regex
  * To reuse the capturing group, you use a *backreference*, which is denoted by a backslash (Ruby) or dollar sign (JavaScript) followed by a digit, e.g. `\1` or `$1`
  * A regex may contain multiple capturing groups
  * Backreferences go in order from `\1` or `\$1` for the backreference for the first capturing group that occurs in the regex, through `\2` or `$2`, `\3` or `$3`, etc.

Example:

```ruby
/(['"]).+?\1/
```

  * This will match either a single-quote `'` or a double-quote `"`, followed by one or more characters, and then another quote of the same type as that captured by the capturing group

<a name='transforming-strings'></a>
## Transforming Strings

  * Transforming strings with regex involves matching the string against a regex and using the results of the match to construct a new string
  * While regex-based transformations are conceptually similar in Ruby and JavaScript, the implementations are different

<a name='transformations-ruby'></a>
### Transformations in Ruby

  * In Ruby, transformations are usually done using the `sub` and `gsub` methods (or `sub!` and `gsub!` for in-place transformations)
  * The `String#sub` method transforms the fist part of a string that matches a given regex
  * The `String#gsub` method transforms every part of the string that matches the regex

Example:

```ruby
'Four score and seven'.sub(/[aeiou]/, '') # => 'Fur score and seven'
'Four score and seven'.gsub(/[aeiou]/, '') # => 'Fr scr nd svn'
```

  * Ruby's [String#sub](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html#method-i-sub) method
  * Ruby's [String#gsub](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html#method-i-sub-21) method
  * Ruby's [String#sub!](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html#method-i-gsub) method
  * Ruby's [String#gsub!](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.2/String.html#method-i-gsub-21) method

<a name='transformations-javaScript'></a>
### Transformations in JavaScript

  * In JavaScript, transformations are usually done using the `replace` method
  * `replace` transforms the part of a string that matches a given regex; if the regex includes the `g` options, the transformation is applied to every match in the string

Example:

```javascript
'Four score and seven'.replace(/[aeiou]/, ''); // 'Fur score and seven'
'Four score and seven'.replace(/[aeiou]/g, ''); // => 'Fr scr nd svn'
```

  * JavaScript's [String.prototype.replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) method
